For more than 100 years, Big Brothers Big Sisters has operated under
 the belief that inherent in every child is the ability to succeed and 
 thrive in life.  Most children served by Big Brothers Big Sisters are in 
 single-parent and low-income families or households where a parent is
  incarcerated.  As the nation’s largest donor and volunteer supported
   mentoring network, Big Brothers Big Sisters makes meaningful, 
   monitored matches between adult volunteers (“Bigs”) and children 
   (“Littles”).  
<br />
<br />
Big Brothers Big Sisters provides a system of ongoing evaluation
 and support which is proven by independent studies to help families by
  improving the odds that “Littles” will perform better in school and avoid
   violence and illegal activities, and have stronger relationships with their
    parents and others. Headquartered in Philadelphia with a network of nearly
     400 agencies across the country, Big Brothers Big Sisters serves a 
     quarter million children annually.

Doing Nothing is Not an Option
Big Brothers Big Sisters Urges Adults to Start Something™ 
To Help Kids Succeed in and out of School
<br />
<br />
Each year brings renewed hope for our future, as individuals, families, communities and as a nation.  The timing could not be better for us to Start Something™ to make a difference.
<br />
<br />
Last year’s release of the film, Waiting for Superman, was a sobering wake-up call that our nation faces a crisis, which is draining productivity and already limited resources.  As we grapple for solutions – more funding for schools, better training for teachers, more involvement from parents – research points to something that we know works, at least as part of the solution – quality mentoring.   
<br />
<br />
Long-standing independent studies widely quoted by mentoring advocates and programs find children enrolled in Big Brothers Big Sisters’ long-term mentoring programs are more likely than their peers to earn higher grades and are less likely to skip classes and school days, factors linked to high school graduation.  Not surprisingly, the same studies find children in these long-term quality mentoring programs are also more likely than their peers to avoid violent and unhealthy behaviors and more likely to have positive relationships with their parents and others.  Most children enrolled in Big Brothers Big Sisters’ nearly 380 mentoring agencies are those of single, low-income and incarcerated parents.
<br />
<br />
By going to BigBrothersBigSisters.org, you can pledge to do what works for you – from donating to sharing stories about what quality mentoring achieves, to volunteering – to help children beat the odds.
<br />
<br />
•	77 percent of children involved in Big Brothers Big Sisters improved their self-confidence<br />
•	55 percent improved their relationships with peers and adults<br />
•	53 percent were able to make better decisions<br />
•	30 percent were less likely to engage in violent behavior<br />
•	48 percent improved their academic performance<br /><br />

We are also fortunate to have new data on Adult Littles. We made sure that many of our funders were present at our national conference when we released new data from a study conducted on our behalf by Harris Interactive® that gives us a first official glimpse at what happens to our Littles when they become adults.  The study found alumni Littles are more likely than their peers to: <br />
•	Have 4-year college degrees. <br />
•	Family incomes of at least $75,000, and are more likely to <br />
•	Have strong family relationships.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Big Brothers Big Sisters believes we can all Start Something to make our nation stronger by supporting families, schools and communities to get kids on the right track.  It doesn’t take much – just a simple pledge.
